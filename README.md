# Project overview :

Staker paradise is a yield farming platform, where the owner can create IVP ( investment Pools ),                               
everyone stake the token allowed by the pool will get a part of the total reward on the pool depends on the user  total staked.

# Use case :
  I believe that the use case and examples is the best way to explain something.
  1) First thing, the owner of the contract will create an investment pool and set :
  `oken address` only the holders of these tokens can stake in this pool
  `ax supply`: each pool has a limit, users can't stake more than the max supply.
  `eposit time`: no one can stake if the deposit time end.
  `in deposit`: minimum deposit.
  `mount of token reward`: the total reward of this pool.
  `take time`: no one can unstake their tokens until the stake time end.
  
  2) user will choose the pools that support his tokens and stake it until the
   stake time end , then user can unstake their tokens and claim reward.
   
  3) now how  the smart contract calculate the reward
    user reward = total reward / user total staked.
    
    
 # Free token :
 
  I made this free token section to get some tokens to participate to 
  to the stking pool. but the owner can order any type of erc20 tokens in the pool.
  
# inventory : 
  here you can see and claim your STP token reward, not that only you see all the pool that you invested in it.
